			   Ristorante Roma is modeled after the Italian trattoria model of dining where the atmosphere is formal, the service is excellent, and a steady clientele is more important than haute cuisine. The dishes are modest with a regional focus and are served in plenty. We strive to present true Italian dining in its most authentic form using bounties of the land and sea while also breaking misconceptions created by Italian-Americanized cuisine. Chef and owner Alex Petrache uses recipes he learned while working in Rome for over 17 years as a cook and chef serving individuals such as Ricky Tognazzi, Raoul Bova, Sabrina Ferilli, Simona Izzo, Andrea Gaspari, Tinto Brass, Luca Barbareschi, Pamela Prati, and Asia Argento. We enjoy making use of seasonal local ingredients when we make our sauces daily and hand make our Tiramisù and Panna Cotta. Ristorante Roma is a small establishment and because of our focus on rapport and repeat clientele we fill up quickly and recommend a reservation.

			   We believe that our food should be as authentic as our atmosphere. We partner with regional providers of the Pacific Northwest such as Cascade Natural, Farmer’s Markets, Carlton Farm, Organically Grown Company, and local farms valuing their focus on sustainability. We actively choose hormone and antibiotic free beef and pork from local sources to pair with seasonally farmed vegetables. We refuse to use preservatives, MSG, and food coloring. Finally we believe that authenticity starts at home where we choose fresh ingredients for our recipes and sauces, as we believe that the best quality of our food rests with the respect for the best ingredients.

		 				A sunny little Italian restaurant on the edge of downtown proper. Their dishes use ingredients imported from Italy like olive oil, canned tomatoes, and pasta. The servers are primarily native Italian speakers and might have a little difficulty with English -how's that for authentic! Simple, Italian food á la Rome with the traditional antipasti, pasta, secondi dishes as well as desert. Vegetarians can be easily accommodated and the wine list is quite nice.<br>

				This humble downtown trattoria is like a direct flight to Rome, cheesy Trevi Fountain murals and boisterous families passing plates of steamed clams and hearty pastas included. Dig into a heap of perfectly al dente noodles tossed with nubs of pancetta, chili-spiced tomato sauce, and a shower of pecorino. It’s a sunny European vacation in a bowl. <br>

				Al Pacino, the Academy Award-winning actor whose movies include "The Godfather" trilogy, "Scarface," "Dog Day Afternoon," "Serpico" and "Heat" made a surprise appearance at a downtown Portland Italian restaurant Saturday evening. Pacino arrived with a party of seven at 6:30 PM and stayed for about two hours, eating a typical Italian meal featuring a primo -- a small pasta course -- followed by a seccondo, or main entree, and contorni, or sides. "He ate everything," notes Petrache.<br>

			&nbsp 	Imagine you’re in Italy. Now imagine you’re in Italy in Portland. While the real Eternal City, with the Sistine Chapel, the Colosseum and the Pantheon, clearly has charms that exceed those of Portland’s Southwest 12th Avenue, the new Ristorante Roma does offer a sweet does of authentic Italia.<br><br>
			&nbsp 	For one thing, the servers have lovely accents and don’t actually speak much English at all. This may lead to humorous or irritating excesses, depending what sort of mood you’re in. <br><br>
			&nbsp 	Order from the “Meat & Fish” section of the menu, and, to your surprise, your meal will be preceded by a mixed salad, which is a bit of a bother if you’ve already ordered and been served  mixed salad from the “entrees” portion. And while there’s nothing wrong with the simple lettuce and tomato, served with cruets of oil and balsamic vinegar for blending your own dressing, most diners probably aren’t going to want more than one head.<br><br>
			&nbsp 	The entrees section includes such beginnings as generous antipasto platters with either sliced meats and cheese or vegetables. The “Vegetale Misto” was more interesting that the straightforward meats, with well-oiled grilled eggplant and zucchini offering contrasting textures to marinated peppers and firm, large beans. <br><br>
			&nbsp 	Another entrée, tortellini in brother, would make a terrific lunch. It’s a large, deep bowl with freshly cooked meat tortellini in hot soup flecked with bits of vegetables. <br><br>
				&nbsp As in traditional cafes in Italy – there are some in New York City, too – take the menu literally. The tilapia con olive, described as a tilapia filet in a white wine sauce topped with olives, is exactly that: a large portion of meltingly tender fish in a simple sauce brightened by lemon and meaty black olives. No truffle oil, no grilled arugula shavings, no baby vegetables on the side.<br><br>
			&nbsp 	The pasta dishes (which don’t come with salad) nearly all cost less than $9, and the portions are big enough to satisfy a Pavarotti appetite. Large raviolis are filled with ricotta and spinach and draped in a meaty tomato sauce. The balance between sauce and noodle is well-struck here and in a hearty, rich rigatoni carbonara, which sparked a conversation about love for bacon that lasted at least three days.<br><br>
			&nbsp 	For dessert, the rectangular slab of tiramisu is so perfectly rendered, with distinct layers of cream and cake and chocolate, you’ll peer over your shoulder to make sure no one’s going to take it away. The espresso, of course, is excellent.
			&nbsp 	Ristorante Roma sits on stretch of downtown Portland that seems weirdly busy on weekend nights. The light switch is turned up higher than in many local restaurants, and I heard a few mildly disparaging “you could perform brain surgery in here” sorts of comments. But the exposed look, completed by faux fresco paintings on one wall, a deli case housing a few giant mounds of meat and cheese and simple tables and chairs, seems to fit with the aesthetic of a place where it’s all about the food on the plate. And taking a virtual trip abroad.<br>

				&nbsp  Some restaurants open with a big bang. They hire publicists, send out barrages of press releases and get Portland’s rabid food aficionados into full froth before they ever even open their doors. From Day 1 – or at least until they hit a run of bad food or service – these restaurants are hits. <br><br>
				&nbsp Other restaurants arrive with nary a peep, like Ristorante Roma, which opened quietly late last month in a completely redone downtown storefront.<br><br>
			&nbsp 	“Sometimes it’s busy at lunch, but some nights it’s slow,” says owner Alexandru Petrache, who relocated to Portland last year after cooking for 17 years in Rome, most recently at a five-star hotel.<br><br>
			&nbsp 	Petrache, who runs the restaurant with his wife, Nurgen, decided to move to Portland after vacationing here in 2004, when he noticed how many Italian restaurants were thriving here. “I felt this was a great town for Italian food,” he said. “And I loved the people.”<br><br>
			&nbsp 	The mood is casual, with large photos of such Italian landmarks as the Trevi Fountain adorning the gold-colored walls. At night the dining room is brightly lit, as if it’s a reaction against the current chic in so many Portland restaurants where the lighting is so low you can’t read the menu.<br><br>
			&nbsp 	Ristorante Roma is a trattoria-style place, so the emphasis is on low-priced everyday far, like a generous portion of pillow-light gnocchi in a smoked salmon cream sauce, or bucatini tossed with Italian bacon and tomatoes. Meat and fish entrees include such dishes as chicken scaloppini, and tilapia and olives in white-wine sauce. None of it will set you back much. With one exception, all the pastas are priced under $9 and the entrees top out at $18, though most are priced fairly lower. With a couple of glasses of wine, a couple could have a meal for well under $40.<br><br>
			&nbsp 	Many of the ingredients in Ristorante Roma’s dishes are imported directly from Italy, including the pastas, prosciutto and salami. “I’m trying to give the atmospheres an authentic feel and traditional menu,” Petrache said.<br>

				   Ristorante Roma is modeled after the Italian trattoria model of dining where the atmosphere is formal, the service is excellent, and a steady clientele is more important than haute cuisine. The dishes are modest with a regional focus and are served in plenty. We strive to present true Italian dining in its most authentic form using bounties of the land and sea while also breaking misconceptions created by Italian-Americanized cuisine. Chef and owner Alex Petrache uses recipes he learned while working in Rome for over 17 years as a cook and chef serving individuals such as Ricky Tognazzi, Raoul Bova, Sabrina Ferilli, Simona Izzo, Andrea Gaspari, Tinto Brass, Luca Barbareschi, Pamela Prati, and Asia Argento. We enjoy making use of seasonal local ingredients when we make our sauces daily and hand make our Tiramisù and Panna Cotta. Ristorante Roma is a small establishment and because of our focus on rapport and repeat clientele we fill up quickly and recommend a reservation.

					<p class="italian">
			   We believe that our food should be as authentic as our atmosphere. We partner with regional providers of the Pacific Northwest such as Cascade Natural, Farmer’s Markets, Carlton Farm, Organically Grown Company, and local farms valuing their focus on sustainability. We actively choose hormone and antibiotic free beef and pork from local sources to pair with seasonally farmed vegetables. We refuse to use preservatives, MSG, and food coloring. Finally we believe that authenticity starts at home where we choose fresh ingredients for our recipes and sauces, as we believe that the best quality of our food rests with the respect for the best ingredients.

		 				A sunny little Italian restaurant on the edge of downtown proper. Their dishes use ingredients imported from Italy like olive oil, canned tomatoes, and pasta. The servers are primarily native Italian speakers and might have a little difficulty with English -how's that for authentic! Simple, Italian food á la Rome with the traditional antipasti, pasta, secondi dishes as well as desert. Vegetarians can be easily accommodated and the wine list is quite nice.<br>

				This humble downtown trattoria is like a direct flight to Rome, cheesy Trevi Fountain murals and boisterous families passing plates of steamed clams and hearty pastas included. Dig into a heap of perfectly al dente noodles tossed with nubs of pancetta, chili-spiced tomato sauce, and a shower of pecorino. It’s a sunny European vacation in a bowl. <br>

				Al Pacino, the Academy Award-winning actor whose movies include "The Godfather" trilogy, "Scarface," "Dog Day Afternoon," "Serpico" and "Heat" made a surprise appearance at a downtown Portland Italian restaurant Saturday evening. Pacino arrived with a party of seven at 6:30 PM and stayed for about two hours, eating a typical Italian meal featuring a primo -- a small pasta course -- followed by a seccondo, or main entree, and contorni, or sides. "He ate everything," notes Petrache.<br>

				&nbsp 	Imagine you’re in Italy. Now imagine you’re in Italy in Portland. While the real Eternal City, with the Sistine Chapel, the Colosseum and the Pantheon, clearly has charms that exceed those of Portland’s Southwest 12th Avenue, the new Ristorante Roma does offer a sweet does of authentic Italia.<br><br>
				&nbsp 	For one thing, the servers have lovely accents and don’t actually speak much English at all. This may lead to humorous or irritating excesses, depending what sort of mood you’re in. <br><br>
				&nbsp 	Order from the “Meat & Fish” section of the menu, and, to your surprise, your meal will be preceded by a mixed salad, which is a bit of a bother if you’ve already ordered and been served  mixed salad from the “entrees” portion. And while there’s nothing wrong with the simple lettuce and tomato, served with cruets of oil and balsamic vinegar for blending your own dressing, most diners probably aren’t going to want more than one head.<br><br>
				&nbsp 	The entrees section includes such beginnings as generous antipasto platters with either sliced meats and cheese or vegetables. The “Vegetale Misto” was more interesting that the straightforward meats, with well-oiled grilled eggplant and zucchini offering contrasting textures to marinated peppers and firm, large beans. <br><br>
				&nbsp 	Another entrée, tortellini in brother, would make a terrific lunch. It’s a large, deep bowl with freshly cooked meat tortellini in hot soup flecked with bits of vegetables. <br><br>
					&nbsp As in traditional cafes in Italy – there are some in New York City, too – take the menu literally. The tilapia con olive, described as a tilapia filet in a white wine sauce topped with olives, is exactly that: a large portion of meltingly tender fish in a simple sauce brightened by lemon and meaty black olives. No truffle oil, no grilled arugula shavings, no baby vegetables on the side.<br><br>
				&nbsp 	The pasta dishes (which don’t come with salad) nearly all cost less than $9, and the portions are big enough to satisfy a Pavarotti appetite. Large raviolis are filled with ricotta and spinach and draped in a meaty tomato sauce. The balance between sauce and noodle is well-struck here and in a hearty, rich rigatoni carbonara, which sparked a conversation about love for bacon that lasted at least three days.<br><br>
				&nbsp 	For dessert, the rectangular slab of tiramisu is so perfectly rendered, with distinct layers of cream and cake and chocolate, you’ll peer over your shoulder to make sure no one’s going to take it away. The espresso, of course, is excellent.
				&nbsp 	Ristorante Roma sits on stretch of downtown Portland that seems weirdly busy on weekend nights. The light switch is turned up higher than in many local restaurants, and I heard a few mildly disparaging “you could perform brain surgery in here” sorts of comments. But the exposed look, completed by faux fresco paintings on one wall, a deli case housing a few giant mounds of meat and cheese and simple tables and chairs, seems to fit with the aesthetic of a place where it’s all about the food on the plate. And taking a virtual trip abroad.<br>
